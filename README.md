# Synonym Generator

This program parses through books or other texts to create demantic descriptor vesctors based on which words appear in the same sentence as other words. Then, it uses a cosine similarlity function to compute the similarity between two words. Using this function, it selects appropriate synonym for the given word.

This algorithm achieved 75% accuracy after training on two books, War & Peace and Swann's Way.
